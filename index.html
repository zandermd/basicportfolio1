    <p>Hi! My name is Zander Dyer. I am 23 years old and am from San Diego, California. I grew up between San Deigo & Phoenix playing sports for as long as I can remember. I played soccer for 8
    years, 2 of those years playing for Sereno Soccer. I continued to play recreational sports as an adult but unfortunately tore my ACL last year. Now I like to hike, swim, and lift weights to stay in shape. I currently work at a dispensery in Tempe and I
    love it. Holistic medicine is one of my passions along side traveling. I hope to one day be a good enough developer so I can work remotely while traveling the world. 
    I think there are so many things to learn from other cultures. It would be a dream come true! During my free time I enojy spending time with my
    dog Daisy that I adopted last year and with my two best friends.</p>
